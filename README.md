# Eve-Ore-Calculator

This is a calculator I created to generate an estimated value of the selected ore in its compressed form based on current market prices (pulled via the EVE API) and user input. 
I used Tkinter to give it a very basic UI in the hopes of making it more user friendly and to make the data easier to visualize.
